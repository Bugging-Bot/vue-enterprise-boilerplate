# DOM structure [namesspace -> graph -> paper]

## 1. namespace contains all the objects that you will use to build your diagrams.

## 2. The graph contains a reference to all components of your diagram

## 3. The paper is responsible for rendering the graph

# Issues / Challenges

# Things to do for productoin grade system

## Part 1: Disabling the Layout (Making the Paper "Read-Only")

1. Disable Interaction: Remove the ability to interact with the elements, such as dragging, resizing, and other interactive features. This can be done by calling paper.disableGrid() and paper.setInteractive(false).
2. Disable Intreactive mode: This can be done by calling paper.disableGrid() and paper.setInteractive(false)

## Part 2: Optimizing for Performance in Production

1. Disable Animation (if any):
2. Lazy Loading:

## 3. Disable Unnecessary Redraws:

1. You can manually disable redrawing of the entire paper or graph unless necessary. For example, you can use paper.trigger('batch:start') and paper.trigger('batch:end') to prevent multiple unnecessary redraws while updating multiple elements.

## 4. Optimize Element Handling (Use Object Pooling):

For large numbers of elements, use an object pooling pattern to reuse existing elements rather than creating new ones every time. This will minimize memory allocation and speed up your rendering process.

## 5. Minimize the Use of cellView Listeners:

Each cell in jointjs may trigger many events, especially if there are multiple listeners. Reduce the number of listeners if possible.

## 6. Batching Graph Updates:

jointjs supports batching operations to avoid multiple re-renders and improve performance. If you're doing multiple updates to the graph or paper, batch them together to minimize redraws.

## 7. Optimize Element Rendering:

1. Dispose Unused Elements: Once a shape is no longer needed, dispose of it manually to avoid memory leaks.
2. Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders: If the graph is static, make sure it's not being re-rendered unless necessary.

## Part 3: Final Optimized Code (Read-Only with Performance Enhancements)
