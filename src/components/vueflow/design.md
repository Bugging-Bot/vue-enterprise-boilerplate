Running Temporal Locally: Workflow Development Example
Once you have Temporal.io installed locally (via Docker or Kubernetes), you can start developing workflows using the SDKs (Go or Java are the most commonly used).

Example (Go SDK)
Install Temporal Go SDK:
To get started, install the Go SDK by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
go get -u go.temporal.io/sdk
Write a Simple Workflow:
Here’s an example of a simple Temporal workflow in Go that you could use to orchestrate multiple AI agents:

go
Copy
Edit
package main

import (
"fmt"
"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
)

// Define the workflow
func AIWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, data string) error {
// Trigger AI agent 1 (e.g., Preprocessing)
err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, AIPreprocess, data).Get(ctx, nil)
if err != nil {
return err
}

    // Trigger AI agent 2 (e.g., Model Training)
    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, AIModelTraining, data).Get(ctx, nil)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Trigger AI agent 3 (e.g., Inference)
    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, AIInference, data).Get(ctx, nil)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    return nil

}

// Define activities for each AI agent
func AIPreprocess(ctx context.Context, data string) error {
fmt.Println("Running AI Preprocessing...")
// Simulate AI preprocessing task
return nil
}

func AIModelTraining(ctx context.Context, data string) error {
fmt.Println("Training AI Model...")
// Simulate AI model training
return nil
}

func AIInference(ctx context.Context, data string) error {
fmt.Println("Performing AI Inference...")
// Simulate AI inference
return nil
}

func main() {
// Create Temporal client
c, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{})
if err != nil {
panic(err)
}
defer c.Close()

    // Start the worker
    w := worker.New(c, "ai-task-queue", worker.Options{})
    w.RegisterWorkflow(AIWorkflow)
    w.RegisterActivity(AIPreprocess)
    w.RegisterActivity(AIModelTraining)
    w.RegisterActivity(AIInference)

    // Start the worker
    err = w.Start()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Start the workflow
    options := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
        TaskQueue: "ai-task-queue",
    }
    we, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), options, AIWorkflow, "SampleData")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Wait for workflow to complete
    err = we.Get(context.Background(), nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Println("Workflow completed successfully!")

}
In this example:

The workflow (AIWorkflow) orchestrates the execution of multiple AI agents (represented by the activities: AIPreprocess, AIModelTraining, and AIInference).

Each AI agent is represented as an activity, and these activities are triggered sequentially within the workflow.

Temporal ensures the state persistence of the workflow and the handling of retries or failure scenarios.

Run the Workflow:
Once the worker is running, it will listen for tasks from the Temporal server. You can run the workflow via Temporal's client API (e.g., the Go SDK) and track its execution.

Conclusion:
Temporal.io is fully open-source and can be easily installed locally via Docker or Kubernetes.

It’s ideal for event-driven and microservice-based architectures, especially for orchestrating long-running workflows and managing multiple AI agents.

Temporal ensures state persistence, fault tolerance, and scalability for workflows across distributed systems.

By using Temporal, you can orchestrate complex AI workflows where multiple AI agents (or services) are managed asynchronously and can interact with one another through stateful workflows.

You said:
i want user to write own workflows using Vue-Flow frontend (Editor) and execute it on Temporal. design me this solution.

ChatGPT said:
To design a solution where users can write their own workflows using a Vue-Flow frontend editor and execute those workflows on Temporal.io, we need to integrate several components. The general approach would involve:

Frontend (Vue.js with Vue-Flow): Users will use an intuitive UI to visually design workflows.

Backend API (Node.js/Express): The backend will handle the communication between the frontend (Vue-Flow editor) and Temporal, including submitting workflows and retrieving results.

Temporal.io: The backend will interact with Temporal's API to submit, monitor, and manage workflows.

Workflow Design: Users will design workflows as workflow templates using the Vue-Flow editor, which will then be transformed into Temporal workflows on the backend.

Storage: Optionally, you might need to persist workflow definitions in a database for future reference or reuse.

High-Level Architecture
Frontend (Vue.js + Vue-Flow):

A user-friendly interface where users can design workflows visually.

Users can drag and drop nodes (representing different workflow tasks) and link them to define the flow.

A JSON-based representation of the workflow is generated, which can then be sent to the backend.

Backend (Node.js/Express):

Exposes an API that interacts with both the Vue-Flow frontend and Temporal.io.

Receives the workflow JSON from the frontend and converts it into a format that Temporal can understand (such as calling the Temporal SDK).

Manages workflow execution, status updates, and logging.

Temporal.io:

Manages the execution of workflows, tasks, retries, etc.

The Temporal backend (usually deployed with Docker or Kubernetes) is responsible for executing the workflows.

Temporal handles the state persistence and fault tolerance.

Step-by-Step Solution Design

1. Frontend (Vue.js + Vue-Flow)
   1.1 Vue-Flow Integration:
   Use Vue-Flow as a workflow editor. Vue-Flow provides a drag-and-drop interface for building flows. Each node in the flow will represent a Temporal activity (task).

Install Vue-Flow:
You can use Vue-Flow to build the UI for creating workflows:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @vue-flow/core
Basic Setup: Initialize Vue-Flow in your Vue component to create a flow editor.

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
import VueFlow from '@vue-flow/core';

export default defineComponent({
components: { VueFlow },
data() {
return {
nodes: [
{ id: '1', label: 'Start', type: 'input' },
{ id: '2', label: 'Preprocessing', type: 'default' },
{ id: '3', label: 'Training', type: 'default' },
{ id: '4', label: 'Inference', type: 'output' },
],
edges: [
{ id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' },
{ id: 'e2-3', source: '2', target: '3' },
{ id: 'e3-4', source: '3', target: '4' },
],
};
},
methods: {
submitWorkflow() {
const workflowDefinition = this.convertToWorkflowJSON();
this.$axios.post('/api/submit-workflow', { workflow: workflowDefinition });
},
convertToWorkflowJSON() {
// Convert Vue-Flow's nodes/edges to Temporal workflow JSON
// Example: [ { activityName: 'Preprocessing', params: {...} }, {...} ]
return this.nodes.map((node) => {
return {
activityName: node.label,
params: {},
};
});
}
}
});
1.2 User Workflow Design:
Users will drag and drop nodes to represent tasks like Preprocessing, Model Training, Inference, etc.

The edges between the nodes represent the order of execution, which will be translated into Temporal's workflow sequence.

1.3 Submit Workflow:
When the user finishes designing the workflow, they can click a Submit button to send the workflow definition (in JSON) to the backend.

2. Backend (Node.js/Express API)
   2.1 API Endpoint to Submit Workflow:
   The backend will expose an API that accepts the workflow JSON from the frontend and executes it on Temporal.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const express = require('express');
const { Client } = require('@temporalio/client');
const { Connection } = require('@temporalio/client');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Set up a Temporal client
const client = new Client({
connection: new Connection(),
});

// Endpoint to submit a workflow
app.post('/api/submit-workflow', async (req, res) => {
const { workflow } = req.body;

try {
const result = await executeWorkflow(workflow);
res.status(200).json({ message: 'Workflow started successfully', result });
} catch (error) {
res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error executing workflow', error: error.message });
}
});

async function executeWorkflow(workflowDefinition) {
// Create a workflow based on the received JSON
const { workflowName, activities } = workflowDefinition;

// Execute the workflow using Temporal's Node.js SDK
const handle = await client.workflow.start(workflowName, {
taskQueue: 'workflow-task-queue',
args: [activities], // Pass activities as input to workflow
});

return handle;
}

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
/api/submit-workflow:

Accepts the workflow JSON from the frontend and calls executeWorkflow to start the workflow on Temporal.

This involves converting the frontend workflow structure into a Temporal workflow that the backend can process.

2.2 Create Temporal Workflow:
The backend will map the received workflow definition (from the frontend) into a Temporal workflow using Temporal's Node.js SDK. For example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const { Worker, WorkflowClient } = require('@temporalio/client');
const { Connection } = require('@temporalio/client');

async function executeWorkflow(workflowDefinition) {
// Temporal Worker definition for processing tasks
const worker = await Worker.create({
taskQueue: 'workflow-task-queue',
workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'), // Path to your workflow file
activities: {
Preprocessing: async (data) => {
console.log('Running preprocessing...');
// Implement Preprocessing logic here
},
Training: async (data) => {
console.log('Training model...');
// Implement Training logic here
},
Inference: async (data) => {
console.log('Running inference...');
// Implement Inference logic here
},
},
});

await worker.run();

// Start the workflow by invoking the appropriate activity
const client = new WorkflowClient({
connection: new Connection(),
});

const handle = await client.workflow.start('aiWorkflow', {
taskQueue: 'workflow-task-queue',
args: [workflowDefinition], // Pass the workflow definition
});

return handle;
}
This setup ensures that the backend can dynamically execute workflows based on user input from the frontend.

3. Temporal Workflow and Activities
   3.1 Defining Temporal Workflow:
   The workflow will orchestrate the activities based on the structure created by the user.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const { defineWorkflow, Workflow } = require('@temporalio/client');

const aiWorkflow = defineWorkflow({
taskQueue: 'workflow-task-queue',
activities: ['Preprocessing', 'Training', 'Inference'],
});

aiWorkflow.execute = async (activities) => {
// Process activities sequentially
for (const activity of activities) {
await Workflow.executeActivity(activity.activityName, activity.params);
}
};
3.2 Workflow Activities:
Each task (like Preprocessing, Training, etc.) is an activity that gets executed in Temporal.

javascript
Copy
Edit
async function Preprocessing(data) {
console.log('Preprocessing data...');
}

async function Training(data) {
console.log('Training model...');
}

async function Inference(data) {
console.log('Running inference...');
} 4. Frontend-Backend Integration and Workflow Execution
The user builds their workflow in Vue-Flow.

The workflow is sent as JSON to the backend.

The backend:

Converts the JSON into a Temporal workflow definition.

Executes the workflow by calling the Temporal SDK.

Temporal manages the state and execution of each activity (such as Preprocessing, Training, and Inference).

Users can monitor workflow progress and view results on the Vue-Flow frontend.

Optional Enhancements
Workflow Storage: Persist workflow definitions in a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to allow users to save and reuse workflows.

Real-time Updates: Integrate WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to send real-time updates to the frontend (e.g., workflow status, results).

Authentication & Authorization: Ensure proper user management and security for accessing and executing workflows.

Summary
Frontend: Use Vue-Flow to visually design workflows. Users drag and drop nodes to define tasks, and a JSON representation of the workflow is generated.

Backend: A Node.js/Express API receives the workflow definition, converts it to a Temporal workflow using the Temporal SDK, and executes it on Temporal.

Temporal: Temporal handles the execution of the workflow, managing retries, state persistence, and fault tolerance.

This approach gives users the flexibility to design custom workflows through a visual interface and executes them reliably in a distributed, event-driven environment using Temporal.

You said:
so Step1: create worflow using vue-flow. Step2: Generate json of workflow from vue-flow workflow. Step3: Using temporal sdk (go or node) to convert it into temporal workflow. Step4: use temporal API's to submit workflow. is my understanding correct ?

ChatGPT said:
Yes, your understanding is absolutely correct! Here’s a concise breakdown of the process, matching your steps:

Step 1: Create Workflow using Vue-Flow
Frontend (Vue-Flow): The user interacts with the visual workflow editor in the Vue.js frontend powered by Vue-Flow.

Users will drag and drop nodes (representing activities) and connect them with edges to define the workflow structure.

Nodes represent individual tasks or activities, while edges define the sequence of execution.

Step 2: Generate JSON of Workflow from Vue-Flow
Vue-Flow will produce a JSON representation of the workflow once the user has completed their design. This JSON will contain:

Nodes: Representing the activities/tasks in the workflow.

Edges: Representing the flow or sequence in which these activities should be executed.

You will write code to convert the nodes and edges into a structured JSON format that represents the workflow. The output will be something like this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"workflowName": "AI Workflow",
"activities": [
{
"name": "Preprocessing",
"params": {}
},
{
"name": "Training",
"params": {}
},
{
"name": "Inference",
"params": {}
}
],
"dependencies": [
{ "from": "Preprocessing", "to": "Training" },
{ "from": "Training", "to": "Inference" }
]
}
Step 3: Using Temporal SDK (Go or Node.js) to Convert JSON into Temporal Workflow
On the backend, you will parse the JSON workflow and convert it into a Temporal workflow using the Temporal SDK (either Go SDK or Node.js SDK).

Temporal Workflow: This is the stateful definition of the workflow, which Temporal will manage. The JSON you received from Vue-Flow will be used to dynamically create a Temporal workflow and define the activities and their execution order.

For example, if you are using Node.js, your backend will:

Parse the JSON into a sequence of activities.

Create a Temporal Workflow by mapping activities to Temporal’s activity functions and defining their execution order.

javascript
Copy
Edit
const { WorkflowClient, Connection } = require('@temporalio/client');
const { Worker } = require('@temporalio/worker');

// Define a simple workflow in Temporal
const workflow = async (workflowDefinition) => {
for (let i = 0; i < workflowDefinition.activities.length; i++) {
const activity = workflowDefinition.activities[i];
await Workflow.executeActivity(activity.name, activity.params);
}
};
Dynamic Workflow Creation: You’ll convert each node (activity) from the JSON into an activity function in Temporal. If the user designs a workflow with multiple tasks, each task (like Preprocessing, Training, Inference) will map to an activity in Temporal.

Step 4: Use Temporal API to Submit the Workflow
Once the workflow is defined (using the Temporal SDK), you will submit it to the Temporal service via the Temporal API.

You will start the workflow and provide it with the task queue and any input parameters.

Temporal will manage the execution, retries, state persistence, and fault tolerance for the workflow.

Example of submitting the workflow using the Node.js SDK:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const client = new WorkflowClient({ connection: new Connection() });

// Submit the workflow for execution
const handle = await client.workflow.start('aiWorkflow', {
taskQueue: 'workflow-task-queue',
args: [workflowDefinition], // Pass workflow definition (activities)
});
Temporal will then execute the workflow according to the sequence defined in the frontend’s Vue-Flow editor.

Summary Flow
Frontend (Vue-Flow): Users design workflows visually.

Generate JSON: Convert the design (nodes + edges) into a JSON format representing the workflow.

Backend (Temporal SDK): Parse the JSON and create a Temporal workflow using the Temporal SDK, mapping nodes to activities.

Submit Workflow: Use the Temporal API to submit the workflow to Temporal for execution.

Additional Considerations:
Error Handling: Temporal will handle retries and failures based on your workflow design (e.g., timeouts, cancellation, retries).

Monitoring: You can expose status updates from Temporal to the frontend using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to keep the user informed of the workflow’s execution.

Persistence: Temporal will ensure the stateful execution of workflows, even in the case of failures or service restarts.

Custom Activities: You may need to write custom activity functions for each task in your workflow (e.g., for Preprocessing, Training, etc.).

With this approach, users can design complex workflows via a Vue-Flow editor, and Temporal will manage their execution, making this a scalable, reliable solution for workflow orchestration.
